states

common base state

-wandering
	while nothing is nearby, wander randomly
	
	Random wandering:

		add or subtract from x and y cooridante randomly
		this needs to be kept track of to make sure they dont just walk in circles:
		x+,y+ --> NE
		x+,y- --> SE
		x-,y+ --> NW
		x-,y- --> SW
		x+ --> E
		x- --> W
		y+ --> N
		y- --> S
		These values will only be incremented by 1 so the pixels dont jump around too
		frantically. Also wont have to worry about cases like this: x + 1, y + 10 which
		isnt really NE as the above states but just N

		The last 10 moves will be tracked in a stack. Previous movements in the stack will
		affect the probability of where the next move will be
		
		Deciding where to move:
		
		The first move, each direction has an equal chance.
		x+,y+ --> NE 0.125
		x+,y- --> SE 0.125
		x-,y+ --> NW 0.125
		x-,y- --> SW 0.125
		x+ --> E 0.125
		x- --> W 0.125
		y+ --> N 0.125
		y- --> S 0.125
		
		As the directions are recorded in the stack, these probabilities will be adjusted:
		TODO figure out how to do this lol
		


Species specific
Herbivore
-forage
	If nothing is nearby, continue wandering
	If food is within x pixels, approach it
	

Carnivore
-hunt
	if no other creature nearby, continue hunting
	if other creature nearby, attack
